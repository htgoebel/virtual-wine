Code moved to Codeberg
===========================

This repo has been moved to
https://codeberg.org/htgoebel/virtual-wine.

I decided to do so since github/Microsoft's Copilot is not respecting
the license of my code.  I'm no longer willed to accept this, which is
nothing but sweating for FOSS developers and capitalistic accumulation
of commons.  For more information about this topic please see
https://www.fsf.org/licensing/copilot/.

I'm looking forward for you contributions at Codeberg.
Codeberg is a democratic community-driven, non-profit software
development platform operated by Codeberg e.V. and centered around
`Codeberg.org <https://codeberg.org/>`_, a Gitea-based software forge.
